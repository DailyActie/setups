README for the upwelling example:

To demonstrate how GETM runs as a slice model in x-direction, an upwelling
test case with stable temperature stratification in a parabolic (in x-direction)
channel and a wind stress of 0.2 N/m**2 in the channel direction (positive
y-axis) is given. After some hours, strong upwelling occurs at the left 
shore, while there is downwelling a the right shore. For enabling 
slice model, the compiler option SLICE_MODEL needs to be given in the 
Makefile.

To generate necessary input files:
make input

The 20 km wide bathymetry with a 40 m deep, parabolic bottom is generated 
in the Topo/ directory. 

A stable temperature profile with a tanh-shape (surface to bottom difference
is about 10 deg C) is generated in the Temp/ directory.

A time varying meteo forcing can be used by setting met_method=2 in 
upwelling.conf. The the variation can be specified in Meteo/meteo.cdl. When
edited do: 'make meteo'.

To prepare the setup for compilation and execution do:
make input:

To generate 'getm.inp' do:
make namelist:

To compile the model:
make

The will make a statically compiled version. If eveything works correct also
a dynamically executable can be used.

To run the model:
./bin/model_prod_?????
