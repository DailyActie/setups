This test case contains a little box with a parabolic bottom topography. 
It's lateral boundaries are lines of constant latitude and longitude, 
respectively. The size of this box corresponds approximately to that
of the "nice_little_box" in Cartesian coordinates. Stratification 
from "tprof.dat" corresponds to a two-layer fluid.
The flow is driven by a constant wind from west.
The run's duration is 10 days, during which you can see some nice
Poincare-type waves in the basin, some upwelling at the northern shore,
and the initiation of a non-linear Kelvin-type wave in the upwelling
region.

This test case serves as a simple example for what is needed when 
working with a regularly spaced, spherical grid. The file "topo_min.nc" 
contains the minimum number of variables for GETM to do a useful run, 
namely:

- The interger "grid_type", 
  telling GETM that you use a spherical grid

- The grid spacings "dlon" and "dlat" in degrees

- The fully polished "bathymetry", 
  defined at the T-points, positive, in meters.
  (the dimensions of this matrix have to correspond to
  "iextr" and "jextr" in the *.dim file when working with
  STATIC allocation). 
   

If one of these is missing, GETM doesn't run. However, it is 
possible to specify more quantities to GETM like the (x,y) positions 
of the (lon,lat) X-points (useful for plotting), and some parameters
of the geographical projection. This delux-version of the topo-file
is called "topo.nc". If GETM doesn't find one of these optional 
quantities, it outputs a warning and sets a default value.

Matlab routines are available to produce the topo-files for this
and other topographies.
