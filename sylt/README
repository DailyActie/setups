For this idealised simulation with realistic bathymetry, 
a bathymetry data set with a horizontal resolution of 200 m X 200 m is used.
An equidistant vertical discretisation with 20 sigma layers is chosen.
The micro time step is 4.4714 s (1/10000 of M2 frequency) and with
M=10, the macro time step is 44.714 s.
A tidal forcing considering 8 harmonic tides
is applied until a periodically steady state is reached.
The periods of the harmonic tides which are not overtides of the M2
tide have been modified for this short term study such that the tidal
forcing is periodic with the M2 tide, for details, 
see Burchard & Bolding (2002).
The minimum depth is chosen as 0.05 m and the critical depth
below which some physical processes are restricted is 0.2 m.
Wind forcing and surface heat fluxes are neglected.

To run the model, do the following:

make namelist
make
./bin/getm*
