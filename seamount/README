README for the seamount example:

A paper describing the setup and a comparison between POM and ROMS can be found
at:
http://marine.rutgers.edu/po/Papers/ezer_etal_2002.pdf

To generate necessary input files:
make input

The bathymetry is generated in the Topo/ directory. Two different seamounts can
be generated according to setting in Topo/Makefile.

The initial temperature profile is generated in Temp/. By setting KMAX in
Temp/Makefile the vertical resolution can be changed - only equidistant 
distribution is supported at present - change Temp/temp.c to change this.

To compile the model:
make

The will make a statically compiled version.

To run the model in serial mode do:
./bin/model_prod_?????

Updated 2011-03-29:
The seamount can be run in parallel. Everything is controlled via the Makefile
-  compilation and running the model. The parallel runs are named 1p, 2p, 4p,
8p and are invoked by e.g. 'make 4p'. Results are put in directory named
after the number of processors.

bdyinfo.dat is included but presently not used.
